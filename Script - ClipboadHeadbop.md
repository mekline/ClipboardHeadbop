#Script for ClipboardHeadbop

#### Intro
Prepare the ‘slate’ whiteboard to show to the camera:
-- Date
-- Study name
-- Condition
-- Subject #
-- (Space for kid’s name)

As of 5/18: Do Baseline condition (no novel verbs) for several subjects to make sure paradigm is stable. 

Welcome kid & family, sign consent forms, write kid's name down, show it to the camera, get settled

Give slip of paper to give to the parents, and tell them there's a quick instruction sheet for them about the experiment (see bottom). *Go over it verbally as well!!!*

#### Warmup

Note: Turn camera on at the beginning of the play/warmup!! - differences here have sometimes mattered for sorting out how to get the kids happy & interested.

Warmup options:

‘Simon Says’

Here's my friend Sarah.  And Sarah says, Hi Name!

Can you wave at her?  Wow, you're waving, yay!!!

And guess what, she's gonna clap her hands! Can you clap your hands? Yay!  Clap your hands!

And she's gonna touch her head! Can you touch your head? (Use your own free hand to demo) Yay!!

'Catch'

Roll a ball/toy back and forth. Talk with the child about what's happening, but don't push them to imitate if they are shy.  Also works with a soft toy that you give back and forth.

'Cool toy'

Explore the tag blanket or another interesting toy.

In all cases, the goal is to have the kid attending to you, happy & smiling, comfortable with at least some kind of interaction with you.  (Especially - if you hold something out & give it to them, do they take it?)


#### Toy introduction

"And guess what, I also have another cool toy...let me just write something down first."

Spend 5-10 seconds actually writing.  Body positions:

- Two-hands: Dominant hand writing, non-dominant wrapping over the top of the clipboad. Clipboard rests on your lap, slightly off center from the toy position. Your knees are facing a bit away but your torso/head should point at child. (shouldn't need to shift much between writing and toy focus)

- One-hand: Dominant hand writing with clipboard on lap. All else the same, but non-dominant hand rests on the table.  Don't be ostentatious, but do use a big movement to put your hand down rather than 'sneaking'. If you move away to interact with the toy, replace your hand in the same way. Make sure hand, toy, and clipboard are all in the same small-ish working space, facing toward child. 

Move away from posture to place toy on the table, right in front of you. ***Note: make sure not to touch top surface of toy at any point.  Pick it up by the sides only.

Return to writing posture.

"Whoa, cool, look at this toy, wow!"

Spend 5-10 sec writing.

#### Toy demo

"Let me show you! Look...."
- "...watch me!"
- "...I'm gonna dax!"
- "...I'm gonna dax my toy!"

Toy demonstration: Start from a straight backed posture. Bend fairly slowly all the way down to hit the toy, then rise fully back up. 

"Wow, cool..."
- "look at that!"
- "I daxed!"
- "I daxed my toy!"

"That's so cool!" (keep writing)

"I'm gonna do that again! Look...."
- "...watch me!"
- "...I'm gonna dax!"
- "...I'm gonna dax my toy!"

Repeat toy demonstration.
"Yeah..."
- "look at that!"
- "I daxed!"
- "I daxed my toy!"

#### Toy handoff (first action)

"That's pretty cool, huh?" (5 sec of writing)

"Now it's your turn! Can you..."
- "...try that?"
- "...dax?"
- "...dax the toy?"

Place the toy at the edge of the table closest to the child.  This should be within easy reach of the child's head!

*Return to the writing posture/keep writing*

#### Exploration

60 second free play window (time it or use your phone; it will feel MUCH longer).  If no immitations are forthcoming, ok to say

- "Can you show me?"
- "Your turn!"

Or one more demonstration with langauge as in 2nd demo above.

As soon as they are interacting with the toy, start the 60 second 'clock' (longer is better than shorter) and attend to your writing.  It's ok to mildly redirect the child to the toy if they are running away/encourage the parent to let them keep playing, otherwise let them go wild :)

#### Wrap-up

"Awesome, great job!!" If the kid has not yet successfully activated the toy, help them do so.

#### Printed instructions for parents

Hello, and thanks for participating in our study today! 

At the end of our game today, I'm going to give your child a toy to play with, but the toy will stop working temporarily

Please let your child play and explore with the toy - if they ask for help, you can say "Hm, I don't know!", but please don't describe the toy or give your child specific instructions. You can direct your child back to the toy by saying “Want to try again?”

After about 60 seconds we will turn the toy back on for your child to play with!
