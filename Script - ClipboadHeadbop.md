#Script for ClipboardHeadbop

#### Intro
- Prepare the ‘slate’ whiteboard to show to the camera:
-- Date
-- Study name
-- Condition
-- Subject #
-- (Space for kid’s name)

- Welcome kid & family, sign consent forms, *camera on*, get settled

#### Warmup

Note: Turn camera on at the beginning of the play/warmup - differences here have sometimes mattered for sorting out how to get the kids happy & interested.

Warmup options:

‘Simon Says’

Here's my friend Sarah.  And Sarah says, Hi Name!

Can you wave at her?  Wow, you're waving, yay!!!

And guess what, she's gonna clap her hands! Can you clap your hands? Yay!  Clap your hands!

And she's gonna touch her head! Can you touch your head? (Use your own free hand to demo) Yay!!

'Catch'

Roll a ball/toy back and forth. Talk with the child about what's happening, but don't push them to imitate if they are shy.  Also works with a soft toy that you give back and forth.

'Cool toy'

Explore the tag blanket or another interesting toy.

In all cases, the goal is to have the kid attending to you, happy & smiling, comfortable with at least some kind of interaction with you.  (Especially - if you hold something out & give it to them, do they take it?)

#### Toy demo

#### Toy handoff (first action)

#### Exploration

#### Wrap-up



And guess what, I also have this cool toy.  Look at my toy!  

*Note: make sure not to touch top surface of toy at any point.  Pick it up by the sides only.

But you know what, I'm cold! (Shivering motions)
I'm gonna wear this blanket.  I'm wrapping myself aaall up... (make a bit of a production about it.  Adjust yourself so hand's free, but NOT visible to child.)

And guess what? I'm gonna dax my toy? (I'm gonna dax at my toy/Look at me!)
*Lean over and touch toy with head, spins
I daxed my toy!/I daxed at my toy/ See that?
 I'm gonna dax my toy again!/I’m gonna dax at my toy again!/ I’m gonna try again!
*Repeat*
I daxed my toy!
I dated my toy/I daxed at my toy/Wow, cool!

(Blanket off again).
Now it's your turn - can you dax the toy?/can you dax at the toy/can you try?
*Hand over to child.  60 second free play window.  If no immitations forthcoming, ok to say 2-3 more times:  Can you dax (at) the toy? or NAME, dax (at) the toy! (or ‘your turn!)
